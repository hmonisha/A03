My repository for IS117-001 (Assignment 3) 
PART 1 - Directions on Using Webstorm :
Webstorm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for Javascript, HTML, CSS, and other modern web technologies. 
Begin by downloading Webstorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ . First, scroll down and click on "apply now" under 'individual license for students and teachers'. Register with your UCID ID and email. An email confirmation will be sent to your email, so verify it. Then follow the instructions and download Webstorm by finding the latest version.
Next, install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads . Under "Downloads", choose your OS. Find the download file and install it by double clicking the file.
Enter Webstorm. If you believe you did not download the latest version, select "configure" from the bottom of the screen, next to the screw icon, and click "check for updates" for latest updates. 
Go to https://github.com/join and sign up for Github with your UCID. 

Next step is to connect Github and Webstorm:
Enter Webstorm and click CTRL+ALT+S for System Preference. Select Version Control Git and enter your path to your GIT.exe into the space next to "Path to GIT executable". 
  - To locate your GIT.exe file on Windows, go to file explorer, 'this pc", "windows :C", program files, 
We also have to add our Github password to Webstorm. So, in System Preference, select "Appearance and Behavior" from the drop down and click system settings and then password. Add location for the password file and click Ok. 
Don't exit from Webstorm. Stay on the same page. Now, select Version Control and then "Git" from the left side to test whether or not Git is connected to Webstorm. Make sure the correct GIT.exe is pasted into the box next to "Path to GIT executable" and click on "Test". If Git and Webstorm are connected successfully, you will receive the message “Git Executed Successfully.”

Let's go back to Github :
Sign in. Click the "+" Icon from the top right and select "New Repository" from the drop down menu. Under "Repository Name", name it something convenient, such as "TestRepositoryIS117". Tip* Use the course number (IS117) to make it easier to find your reposotories in the future. Under "description", write what the repository is about or anything that will help you remember why the repository was created. Make sure to select "public", not "private", then select "Add a README file", and select "Create Repository" from the bottom, highlighted in green. 
After clicking on "Create Repository", click "README.md" on top of the repository name and click the pencil icon from the right of "README.md". Here, write a short description for the repository, such as "This is my first repository", it could be anything. Then click "commit changes".
